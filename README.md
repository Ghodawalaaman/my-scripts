# My Scripts
This repo contains all the script that I use daily.

- rts : This script removes trailing space from a file or standart input. It can be integrated in vim.
- cbt : 'cbt' is abbreviation for "Connect to bluetooth". This script connects your device to a bluetooth device. you have to pass the mac address of the bluetooth device as command line argument.
- rbg : It selects a random image from '/home/${USER}/wallpapers' and checks the evironment whether it's wayland or xorg and according to the evironment it uses different commands to change wallpaper.
